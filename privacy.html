    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: <!-- set date --> January 6, 2026</p>

    <p>
      Bourbon Pourcast (“Bourbon Pourcast,” “we,” “us”) provides informational alerts and reporting related to public
      alcoholic beverage control (ABC) inventory and allocation announcements (the “Service”).
      This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contact information you provide:</strong> email address and/or mobile phone number when you sign up for alerts.</li>
      <li><strong>Opt-in records:</strong> information needed to demonstrate consent (e.g., the date/time you opted in and the source of opt-in).</li>
      <li><strong>Basic website usage data:</strong> limited technical data such as browser type or approximate analytics (if enabled on the site).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To send you the alerts you requested (email and/or SMS).</li>
      <li>To operate, maintain, and improve the Service (for example, ensuring alerts send reliably).</li>
      <li>To respond to support requests and troubleshoot issues.</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations and prevent abuse (e.g., rate limiting or fraud prevention).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>SMS / Text Messaging Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      If you opt in to SMS alerts, we will use your mobile phone number only to send Bourbon Pourcast alerts and to manage
      your subscription status (including STOP/HELP handling).
    </p>
    <p><strong>We do not sell, rent, or share your mobile number or SMS opt-in data with third parties for their marketing or promotional purposes.</strong></p>

    <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>We may share information only in these limited cases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> companies that help us operate the Service (for example, email delivery providers or SMS providers).
        They may process data only on our instructions and for the purposes described in this policy.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal / safety:</strong> if required by law, or to protect the rights, safety, and security of Bourbon Pourcast and users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain contact information for as long as you remain subscribed, and for a reasonable period afterward to maintain
      records of consent, comply with legal requirements, and prevent re-subscription abuse. You may request deletion at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SMS:</strong> Reply <strong>STOP</strong> to unsubscribe. Reply <strong>HELP</strong> for help.</li>
      <li><strong>Email:</strong> Use the unsubscribe method provided in the email (or contact us to remove you).</li>
      <li><strong>Deletion requests:</strong> Contact us at the email below to request deletion of your contact details.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable administrative and technical measures to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is
      100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>
